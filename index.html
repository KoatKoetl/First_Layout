                <h3>Essay about Earth</h3>
              <p>Within the first billion years of world's history, time looked in the seas and started to change the world's air and aspect, 
                leading to the development of aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Some geological information suggests that living may have originated as such as 
                4.1 billion years ago. Since then, this sequence of world's space from the Sun, physical attributes, and geological history have allowed time 
                to change and thrive. In the history of this world, diversity has gone through longer periods of expansion, occasionally punctuated by large-scale extinction results. 
                Around 99 percent of all species that ever lived on land are dead. Estimates of the number of species on world nowadays differ widely; most varieties have not been 
                identified. Around 7.6 billion humans live on land and rely on its biosphere and raw materials for their life. Humans have produced different societies and civilizations; 
                politically, the world has almost 200 autonomous states.
